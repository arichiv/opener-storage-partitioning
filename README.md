## Introduction

This proposal seeks to prevent or limit same-origin cross-frame communication that can bypass [storage partitioning](https://developer.chrome.com/en/docs/privacy-sandbox/storage-partitioning/), and to do so in alignment with existing work on the [Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy)https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy.
